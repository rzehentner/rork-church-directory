## Image Cropping Debug Log

### Issue Summary
The image cropping feature is not working correctly. The saved image doesn't match the crop shown in the preview.

### Key Problems Identified:
1. **Aspect Ratio Frame Calculation**: The frame dimensions are being calculated correctly for 4:3 aspect ratio
2. **Pan Gesture Handling**: The pan gesture was bouncing around due to incorrect offset handling
3. **Crop Calculation**: The crop boundaries need to account for the inverted pan values correctly

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Frame Dimension Calculation**:
   - Now properly calculates frame dimensions that maintain aspect ratio
   - Uses screen bounds to ensure frame fits on screen
   - For 4:3 ratio: calculates proper width/height that fits within screen

2. **Improved Initial Scale Calculation**:
   - Ensures image always covers the entire frame
   - Calculates minimum scale to prevent gaps
   - Adds 5% buffer for better coverage

3. **Fixed Pan Gesture Handling**:
   - Reduced pinch-to-zoom sensitivity (0.003 instead of 0.01)
   - Fixed pan limits calculation
   - Properly clamps pan values to prevent excessive movement

4. **Enhanced Crop Calculation**:
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Properly inverts pan values for crop calculation
   - Maintains aspect ratio after crop for family photos

5. **Zoom Controls**:
   - Zoom out now respects minimum scale to ensure frame coverage
   - Added smooth spring animations

### Testing Steps:
1. Open Family tab
2. Tap on "Add Family Photo"
3. Select an image from gallery
4. The image should appear in a 4:3 aspect ratio frame
5. Try to:
   - Drag to position the image
   - Pinch to zoom
   - Use zoom in/out buttons
   - Rotate the image
6. Tap the check mark to save
7. The saved image should match what was shown in the crop preview

### Expected Behavior:
- 4:3 aspect ratio frame for family photos
- Smooth pan and zoom gestures
- Accurate crop that matches preview
- Saved image maintains 4:3 aspect ratio

### Console Logs to Monitor:
Look for these log entries:
- `[ImageUploader] Image selected for editing`
- `[ImageUploader] Crop calculations`
- `[ImageUploader] Applying manipulations`
- `[ImageUploader] Image processed`
- `[ImageUploader] Photo uploaded successfully`

### Current Status:
✅ Fixed aspect ratio frame calculation
✅ Improved gesture handling
✅ Enhanced crop accuracy
✅ Added proper logging
