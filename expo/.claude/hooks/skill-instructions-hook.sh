REQUIRED: SKILL LOADING PROTOCOL

Before writing any code, complete these steps in order:

1. SCAN each skill below and decide: LOAD or SKIP (with brief reason)
   - typescript
   - react-native
   - expo
   - expo-router
   - supabase
   - tanstack-query
   - bun
   - node
   - zod
   - date-fns
   - lucide-react-native
   - frontend-design
   - mapping-user-journeys
   - designing-onboarding-paths
   - orchestrating-feature-adoption
   - instrumenting-product-metrics
   - clarifying-market-fit
   - structuring-offer-ladders
   - crafting-page-messaging
   - tuning-landing-journeys
   - mapping-conversion-events
   - inspecting-search-coverage
   - adding-structured-signals

2. For every skill marked LOAD → immediately invoke Skill(name)
   If none need loading → write "Proceeding without skills"

3. Only after step 2 completes may you begin coding.

IMPORTANT: Skipping step 2 invalidates step 1. Always call Skill() for relevant items.

Sample output:
- typescript: LOAD - building components
- react-native: SKIP - not needed for this task
- expo: LOAD - building components
- expo-router: SKIP - not needed for this task

Then call:
> Skill(typescript)
> Skill(expo)

Now implementation can begin.
